//! `WakeWatcher`: the daemon's record that a session is holding `/hook/wait`.
//!
//! This is separate from `Session` because the gate lets a machine write its own
//! `Session` row whole, so a field there would only be a claim. The gate refuses
//! a client's events on any other entity, so only the daemon can write this one.
//! A session can have more than one wake path, and each path has a record of its own
//! (MUS-94), so ending one path leaves the others. A held `/hook/wait`'s record has the
//! session id as its `id` and no `session_id`, which is also how records were keyed
//! before MUS-94, so readers built before it still see Claude's waiters. A Codex
//! bridge's record has its own `id` (see [`WakeWatcher::bridge_id`]) and names its
//! session in `session_id`. Use [`WakeWatcher::session`] to find the session.
